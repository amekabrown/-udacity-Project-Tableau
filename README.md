The data consisted of many reasons why airlines,airports & flights dealt with cancelations in the year of 2015
1st insight shows the airline delays by using a scatter plot chart and see that WN has the most delays 
2nd insight shows the impact of security delays per airport by using a gnatt chart in the month of November, I choose that month due to holidays, PHX & MIA were the top two airports for securtiy delays in November. 
In my dashboard the top chart shows which airline has the most air time which is WN this is easily seen using the horizontal bar chart. The bottom chart also uses a tree map chart to show which airline has the most weather delays, DL.
